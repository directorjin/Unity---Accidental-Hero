2. The second stage is fighting stage against Goblin.
Goblin patrols the designated area. If Goblin detects the player, it approaches.
However, as the distance between Goblin and the player becomes remote, they return to their original positions and patrol the designated areas.
The player installs traps and attracts and kills goblin.
The player takes time to install the trap, so the player has to think carefully about it.

Goblin patrols each set of places.

3. The third stage is puzzle stage like Pok√©mon's ice cave.
The player slides on the ice. So we have to go in four directions.
You can't go back to where you've been.

The player cannot operate the keyboard on the ice.

Once you've passed, it's an X mark. If you go to the place marked X, the puzzle is initialized.

4. The fourth stage is boss stage. 
The boss has three attack patterns.
Poisonous needles spitting, magical star, dash.
The boss loses his health when he hits his head against a wall during a dash pattern.

magical star.
Goblin uses magic to create a pink road on the floor, and two seconds later, stars are created and moved to the pink road.
When you touch a star, you lose your health.

After using the magic pattern, Goblin uses the dash pattern. 
When the player avoids the goblin dash, the goblin hits his head against a wall and lose his health.
